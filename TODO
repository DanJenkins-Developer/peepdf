✅ Alternative Suggestion (Recommended)

If you’re trying to use peepdf, and it’s requiring PyV8 for JavaScript analysis, consider:

    Skipping JavaScript emulation if it's not critical.

    Using jsbeautifier or js2py instead for parsing/analysis.

    Trying to install older, prebuilt versions of PyV8, though these rarely work on Windows without patching.
